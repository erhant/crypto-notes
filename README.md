# build
mdbook build
```

Some things to note:

- [mdbook-katex](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex) for math displays (better alternative to MathJax)
- [mdbook-mermaid](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-mermaid) for MermaidJS renders
- [mdbook-toc](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc) for table of contents
- [a small custom CSS](./custom.css) is used to align Mermaid outputs to center.
- [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to lint the pages (if i feel like it).
