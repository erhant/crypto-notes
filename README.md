# Cryptography Notes

> Notes from several resources, based on Cryptography, Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Number Theory.

## Usage

```sh
# serve
mdbook serve --open

# build
mdbook build
```

We use the following preprocessors:

- [mdbook-katex](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex) for math displays (better alternative to MathJax)
- [mdbook-mermaid](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-mermaid) for MermaidJS renders
- [mdbook-toc](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc) for table of contents

A tiny [custom CSS](./custom.css) is used to align Mermaid outputs to center.

We may also use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to lint the pages (if i feel like it).
